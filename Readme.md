To use these, you have to curently manually copy and paste into each to new session, or to restart a session.

I'm sure eventually there will  be a `~/.gpt-N.rc` file or the like. For the moment, this is the closest thing.

Don't be scared they are Markup files. That has been dealt with. Just past the raw file text.

PRs welcome.

## General Chat-4

*Note* that your output will differ widely every time you use it. The best way to think about it that ChatGPT has a diferent personaly each time. I don't how else to put it.

That said, it generally follows the rules as given in the prelude text in this repo.

Here's my[GPT-Start-4.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cschladetsch/GPT-Startup-Scripts/master/GPT-Start-4.md) prelude. It provides:

* `>` a `bash` terminal
* `c>` a *C++* compiler (generally gcc)
* `p>` a *Python interpreter* (generally 3.8)
* `h>` a *HP48 calculuator* (under construction) [1]

[1] The calculator is a work in progress but seems to be going well. Obviosuly there are no OOTB graphing systems, but I am working around that.

## Unity 22.x

[Latest Unity](Unity-22.x.md)

There will be most work done here.
