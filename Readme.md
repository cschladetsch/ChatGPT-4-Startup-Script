To use these, you have to curently manually copy and paste into each to new session, ot to restart a session.

I'm sure eventually there will  be a `~/.gpt-N.rc` file or the like. For the moment, this is the clostest thing.

PRs welcome.

## General Chat-4

*Note* that your output will differ widely every time you use it. The best way to think about it that ChatGPT has a diferent personaly each time. I don't how else to put it.

That said, it generally follows the rules as given in the prelude text in this repo.

Here's my [Current GPT-4](GPT-Start-4.txt) prelude. It provides:

* `>` a `bash` terminal
* `c>` a *C++* compiler (generally gcc)
* `p>` a *Python interpreter* (generally 3.8)
* `h>` a *HP48 calculuator* (under construction) [1]

[1] The calculator is a work in progress but seems to be going well. Obviosuly there are no OOTB graphing systems, but I am working around that.

## Unity 22.x

[Latest Unity](Unity-22.x.txt)

There will be most work done here.
